<p>
 	Gardy Kevin Ligonde is currently a sophomore majoring in Mechanical Engineering at Tufts University. He is expected to graduate in 2016 and hopes to also complete a minor in Computer Science.

	Kevin was born on June 27, 1994 in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Until he moved to the United States, he attended Institution Saint Louis de Gonzague, a private Roman Catholic school. Later on Kevin realized that the rigorous education that he endured while in that school was the reason why he was able to make it to college. While he was mostly focused on his academics, Kevin was also interested in extra curricular activities such as basketball and track and field. Around February 2009, he would go through one of the biggest transitions so far in his life. Kevin moved to Jacksonville, Florida and went to Creekside High School. One of the biggest challenges that he faced was having to cope with a different learning style (English) and being able to familiarize himself with a different culture. There's not much to say about his high school experience there so let's move on. Around June 2010, Kevin moved to Harwich, a small town in Cape Cod. At this point there's not much to say either either except that he ran track and did cross country for a semester. He also picked up a new hobby as he became fascinated with performing card tricks. And now... He's at Tufts. Besides trying to survive the college lifestyle, he watches YouTube videos and surfs the web for the most random things.

	One of Kevin's aspirations is to one day be like Huey Freeman, a fictional character of the series called The Boondocks, a show by Aaron McGruder (so not Huey P. Newton). Why, you may ask? For no particular reason, he's just pretty cool in general. One day, Kevin hopes to be involved in something biomechanics related. He wants to find ways to help/improve human abilities, whether they be the development of synthetic limbs or just mega awesome robotic components that can be added to a person's body to give them superhuman strength. Yeah... that's pretty much it for now.
